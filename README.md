CS-112 Object-Oriented Programming Project

Welcome to the repository for the CS-112 Object-Oriented Programming second-semester project, developed by [Your Name] and Asad Shayan under the guidance of Prof. Dr. Zahid Halim.

Contents:

Presentation: This folder contains a comprehensive presentation file detailing the project's objectives, methodologies, functionalities, and implementation details. It offers a structured overview of the project's scope and significance.

Video Presentation: Explore our project in action through a video presentation located in this folder. Witness firsthand how our dynamic GUI application operates, providing insights into its features and functionalities.

Program: The heart of our project lies in this directory. Here, you'll find the source code and executable files for our dynamic GUI application for data analysis. The application boasts functionalities such as computing Pearson’s correlation coefficients, visualizing bitmap data, and providing a user-friendly interface.

Dataset: In this directory, you'll find the datasets used for testing and demonstration purposes in our application. These datasets showcase the versatility and efficacy of our data analysis functionalities.

Usage:

1.	Loading the Dataset’s Data into a dynamically allocated 2D array.
2.	Then allocating another Matrix of RxR (NxN) size for storing the Pearson’s Correlation Coefficients.
3.	Finding the Column Mean of the Pearson Matrix and then making a Binary Matrix based on the Column means of different columns of the Pearson Matrix.
4.	Plotting the Binary Matrix on the Bitmap.
5.	Plotting the Pearson Matrix on the Bitmap.
6.	Now, shuffling the Data matrix again and finding the Pearson’s Correlation Matrix and Binary Matrix.
7.	Now plotting this Permuted Data Matrix.
8.	Now using the signature technique to retrieve the original Data Matrix again. 
9.	Plotting the Data Matrix again after using the signature technique.
